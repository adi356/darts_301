# Darts League

Web application for keeping score of a darts game, specifically 301.


# In the Works

1. Game needs to end when first person hits 301 instead of letting other player continue
2. Hope to soon add scoring for 501 and cricket
3. Ability to sign into a profile that keeps track of your MPR
4. Ability to create leagues with up to 10 teams (30 players total)
